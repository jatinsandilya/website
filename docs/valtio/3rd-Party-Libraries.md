Valtio provides bare necessities for proxy state management which is great for most projects; however, some users wish to extend the library's feature set. This can be done using 3rd-party libraries created by the community.

> Disclaimer: These libraries may have bugs, limited maintenance, or other limitations and are not officially recommended by pmndrs or the valtio maintainers. This list is to provide a good starting point for someone looking to extend valtio's feature set.
